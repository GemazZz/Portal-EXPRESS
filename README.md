# TAM Project Backend

This is the backend for the TAM (Tbilisi Air Manufacturer) project. The project consists of two main sections: an information page for workers and a testing page where employees can take tests relevant to their job category. Administrators can manage employees, categories, and tests, and view employee performance statistics privately. The project uses a JSON file as a local database, avoiding the need for any external database or hosting service.
